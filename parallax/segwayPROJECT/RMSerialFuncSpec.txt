        MOVE = 217,
        ACK = 218,
        STOP = 219,
        TURN = 220,

        COMMAND_STOP = 233;

Send an ACK after a successful TURN or RELTURN

Format: COMMAND_START <COMMAND> <byte shit[]> COMMAND_STOP

byte shit[] can be nothing. So the sequence is just COMMAND_START <COMMAND> COMMAND_STOP

for MOVE: COMMAND_START MOVE left right COMMAND_STOP.

for turning: COMMAND_START <TURN,TURNREL> first_part second_part COMMAND_STOP
angle = first_part + second_part
