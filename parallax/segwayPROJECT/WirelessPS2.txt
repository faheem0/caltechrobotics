Notes:
    -The wireless controller used was a Pelican Chameleon wireless ps2 controller, all references
     to a wireless controller refer to this model.
    -The following observations are based off of the code for the Javelin Stamp

Similarities with wired and wireless:
    ID is same: ID ='A'=65 (decimal)=0x41 (hex) for digital (just buttons)
                ID ='s'=115 (decimal)=0x73 (hex) for analog (buttons + joysticks)
    Data order is same EXCEPT all button and joystick data arrives 2 bits earlier for wireless
	Exceptions: no "select" button bit for wireless

Differences:
    Status for wired is: 'Z'=90 (decimal) = 0x5A (hex)
    Status for wireless is: an 0 with two dots ontop= -42 (decimal)= ? (hex)

What to change to wired code to make it work for wireless:
    Do NOT use the manual shift function to get the final byte (left joy, y-axis), just
	use built in shift function.
    Shift all data 2 bits sooner.

Some Info about the joystick values:

			 0
			 ^
			 |
		        127

			 O
	0<--->127	OOO	-128<--->-1
			 O

		       -128
		 	 ^
	 	 	 |
		 	-1

    Note that this diagram holds true for both the left and right joysticks.
    Also, -128 comes after 127 (2's complement), so if the joystick is moved
	from left to right (or from up to down), it will read:
		0,1,2,...,125,126,127,-128,-127,-126,...,-3,-2,-1
