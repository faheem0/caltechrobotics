how to ROM: 
-download OH86 from the website, copy/paste in working folder
-add "OH86 startup TO startup.hex" to the end of the batch file
-assemble and link the bootcode (written a long time ago, just initializes UCS (ROM)
-remember to move the include file into the same folder as the boot code .asm file
-change the locate command parameters-code segment to start at 0f8000h, add a "boot" segment starting at 0ffff0h
-in the startup code (c0smrom.asm orginally) delete the "START" on the last line, "END START"
-change the "START:" to a "START LABEL FAR" and "PUBLIC START" on the next line
-put an "END" at the very end of the boot code
-move the extrn in the boot code outside of the segment
-link the boot code last
